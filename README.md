🌻 I’m someone who finds joy in exploring how code can build not just software, but systems, stories, and impact.  
Currently in my first year, I’m building a strong foundation in core programming (C/C++), system-level thinking, and meaningful digital projects.

## 🔧 Currently Working On

### 📨 Sandesh – A CLI-Based Secure Communication Simulator (in C)  
A lightweight, terminal-based tool simulating a secure message transmission system  
- Focuses on **string manipulation**, **pointer logic**, **user authentication**, and **basic encryption simulation**  
- Designed with defence-inspired use cases in mind  
- Inspired by systems that balance **low memory** with **high reliability**

## 🛰️ Vision

To bridge **fundamental CS concepts** with **defence & research-oriented applications**.  
My long-term goal is to contribute to systems that matter be it in **national defence**, **AI ethics**, or **human-first design**. I believe in working with humility, depth, and direction.
